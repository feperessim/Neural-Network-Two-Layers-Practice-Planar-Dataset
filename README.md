# Neural-Network-Two-Layes-Practice-Planar-Dataset
Neural Network - Two layer - X hidden units on Planar dataset

After completed the first course of Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera taught by Andrew Ng, I am implementing the algorithms on my own to retain the material taught.

In this notebook, Iam implementing a two layers neural network algorithm which is used on Planes in Satellite Imagery dataset which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/rhammell/planesnet/home
